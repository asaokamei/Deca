Deca
====

A PHP framework I can use for a decade, hopefully. 

It is built from a set of reliable and (rather small) packages, such as,

- Slim4,
- PHP-DI,
- nyholm/psr7,
- monolog,
- Twig (using `slim/twig-view`)
- Aura/Session
- filp/whoops

Please read more in [Japanese readme file](README.ja.md).
